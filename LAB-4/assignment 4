/*
Question 1: 
an aggregate function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input on certain criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning.
GROUP BY Statement in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups with the help of some functions. i.e if a particular column has same values in different rows then it will arrange these rows in a group.

Important Points:

GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT statement.
In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed after the WHERE clause.
In the query, GROUP BY clause is placed before ORDER BY clause if used any.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: 
It is a table that is automatically created by Oracle Database along with the data dictionary. DUAL is in the schema of the user SYS but is accessible by the name DUAL to all users. It has one column, DUMMY, defined to be VARCHAR2(1), and contains one row with a value X.

DUAL is in the schema of the user SYS but is accessible by the name DUAL to all users. It has one column, DUMMY , defined to be VARCHAR2(1) , and contains one row with a value X . Selecting from the DUAL table is useful for computing a constant expression with the SELECT statement.
